[Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/) is a "Resilient Platform for Contractual Money." It is designed to be a platform for applications with the main focus to provide an efficient, secure and easy way to implement financial contracts. **ergo.py** is an adaptation of the [explorer API](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/blocks/) for *Python*.

As a temporary solution to access pricing, you will need to install the [pycoingecko](https://pypi.org/project/pycoingecko/) library.
